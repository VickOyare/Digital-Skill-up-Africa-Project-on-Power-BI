# Digital-Skill-up-Africa-Project-on-Power-BI
Palmora Group HR Analysis was done in order to generate insights that can be solutions to the problem of gender inequality across the three regions/states (Kaduna, Lagos and Abuja). The analysis involve cleaning and wrangling of data, analyzing and visualization of the data in order to generate insights of what could  be the solutions.
## Project Topic: Palmora Data Analysis
## Project Overview: 
The project files are of two categories. The main file contain information such as (names, department, gender, salary, rating) while the second file contain department and rating bonus for salary improvement.
The data was imported and cleaned using the Extraction, Transform and Load(ETL) method. 
After the cleaning, analysis and visualization of the  data was done using visualization tools mostly and it is basically aimed at gender inequality.
Sets of Visualization tools used are:
- Clustered column chart
- Question and Answer(Q&A)
- Pie chart
- Matrix
- Addition of columns step etc.
The required and expected answers were gotten and I can categorically say there is gender inequality in the company in both department and location or region in favour of the male employee
## Tools Used:
Power BI: This is used for the following:
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning using Extraction, Transform and Load (ETL) method.
- Data manipulation 
- Data munching
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Creating Report
- For Presentation
Tools of data visualization used are:
- Clustered column chart
- Question and Answer(Q&A)
- Pie chart
- Matrix
### Data Cleaning / Preparation:
The following are steps taken when cleaning the data:
- Data were extracted from the desktop into the power BI
- Data were transformed and cleaned by: 
- Null rows were removed
- Empty rows were removed
- And generic gender (individual) was applied to all those without gender
At this point the data is clean loaded, saved, and ready to be analyzed and visualized.
## Exploratory Data Analysis:
After cleaning and wrangling, it was loaded and saved. A relationship was created between these two files as multiple to multiple connection  which help me to merged the two tables as “merged table” and this table contained all the information together with the “Rating Bonus” needed for the calculation of the “Bonus”.
Visualization tools was used to visualize and analyze the data based on the following questions and the expected results. 
- What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and department
- Show insights on ratings based on gender
- Analyze the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, Identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
- A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
- Does palmoria meet this requirement?
- Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. for example.
- How many employees fall into the category of $10,000-$20,000, $20,000-$30,000 etc?
- Also visualize this by regions.
- Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees.
- Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus).
- Total amount to be paid-out per region and company
## Data Analysis: 
- Some charts such as clustered bar chart was used to determine the gender gap and also to determine the department that should be focused on, so also the regions.
- Question and Answer(Q&A) was used to determine the average salary of the company in order to know if the company can pay the minimum of $90,000 or not.
- Matrix was used to create a table that contain the calculation for the bonus to be paid and the total salary to be paid to individual employee.
- The total salary to be paid-out per department and regions were also summarized in matrix table and also visualized by charts.

## Results and findings:
- Kaduna has more male employees followed by Lagos and lastly Abuja
- The male are rated more than the female
- There is gender pay gap in favour of the male employee and the following departments should be put into consideration in the following order “product management, Legal, Support and Accounting. However, in research the female employees are more than the male employee.
- Kaduna has more pay than Lagos and Lastly Abuja and the male employees are favoured.
- The average salary of the employees in the company is $73,703.67. therefore the company doesn’t meet meet the requirement of $90,000 minimum wage payment.
- The pay bucket was
        $21,000-$40,000 = 122 employees
        $41,000-$60,000 = 182 employees
         $61,000-$80,000 =199 employees
         $81,000-$100,000 = 181 employees
          >$100,000 = 190 employees
Therefore, more employees collect the salary between $61,000-$80,000.
Kaduna has the highest pay in all the pay bucket except in $41,000-$60,000 that was lead by Abuja region.
Total amount of money to be paid-out inclusive of salary and bonus per region and company-wide are:
